# Account Changer

**Account Changer** is a powerful Spigot server-side plugin designed to enhance player convenience. It allows users to seamlessly switch their Minecraft accounts *in-game* via an intuitive GUI, eliminating the need to disconnect or use any client-side modifications. This plugin is useful for accounts management in offline servers, since it is designed originally for offline servers.

### Key Features

- **Requirements**: [**ProtocolLib**](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib "ProtocolLib"), **Spigot/Paper 1.20.1+**(tested for **1.20.1** and **1.21.3**).

### Getting Started

```
#### Configuration Parameters

1. **`Players`**  
   - This section contains a list of players, each entry starting with `-`.  
   - Players listed here will **log in directly** without going through any account selection steps.  
   - Players **not listed** will be presented with a GUI to **choose an account** from the available options.

2. **`MaxPlayer`**  
   - An integer that sets the **maximum number of player accounts** available to choose from.  
   - Determines the **GUI window size** (number of inventory slots).

3. **`MaxWait`**  
   - An integer that defines the **maximum time (in seconds)** a player has to rejoin the server after selecting an account.  
   - If the player takes longer than this time, the selected account will expire, and the player will need to select an account again.
